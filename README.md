# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jakub, and I'm a programmer with a passion for Rust and Typescript. I'm also interested in Cybersecurity and related topics.

In my leisure time, I find myself occupied with a variety of activities such as completing challenges on HackTheBox, programming, studying for school, and playing Etterna. These pursuits not only keep me busy, but also provide an enjoyable way to pass the time.

I have experience in fullstack web development and desktop application development.

My projects are an exciting combination of cutting-edge technology, making them ideal for developers and IT professionals alike. From the Tiktok clone, a fullstack project with Nuxt, Nest.js, Neo4J, and Redis, to CNVM, a Node.js version manager written in Rust, to Netscrape, a powerful command line tool written in C for sniffing and printing incoming packets, you're sure to find something to suit your needs. With these projects, you can easily keep up with the latest trends and stay ahead of the competition!

Feel free to check out the three projects pinned below this README, these are probably the ones that I am most proud of.

Thanks for visiting!
