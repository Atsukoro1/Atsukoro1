# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jakub, and I'm a programmer with a passion for Rust and Typescript. I'm also interested in Cybersecurity and related topics.

I have experience in fullstack web development and desktop application development.

My projects are an exciting combination of cutting-edge technology, making them ideal for developers and IT professionals alike. From the Tiktok clone, a fullstack project with Nuxt, Nest.js, Neo4J, and Redis, to CNVM, a Node.js version manager written in Rust, to Netscrape, a powerful command line tool written in C for sniffing and printing incoming packets, you're sure to find something to suit your needs. With these projects, you can easily keep up with the latest trends and stay ahead of the competition!

Feel free to check out my GitHub profile to see more of my work.

Thanks for visiting!
