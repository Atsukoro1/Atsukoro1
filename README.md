Greetings, my name is Jakub, and I am a proficient programmer with a keen interest in Rust and Typescript. My areas of focus also include Cybersecurity and related subjects.

During my downtime, I engage in a diverse range of activities such as tackling challenges on HackTheBox, programming, pursuing academic studies, and playing Etterna. These endeavors not only maintain my engagement, but also offer a stimulating way to utilize my free time.

I possess expertise in both full-stack web development and desktop application development.

My projects embody an innovative fusion of state-of-the-art technology, rendering them highly suitable for developers and IT professionals alike. From the Tiktok replica—a full-stack project utilizing Nuxt, Nest.js, Neo4J, and Redis—to CNVM, a Node.js version manager developed in Rust, and Netscrape, an advanced command-line utility crafted in C for capturing and displaying incoming packets, there is a project to meet diverse requirements. By leveraging these projects, you can readily stay abreast of the latest advancements and maintain a competitive edge!

Thank you for your visit!
